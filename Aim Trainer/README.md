# Python Aim Trainer Game

This Python script creates a simple aim trainer game using the Pygame library. The aim of the game is to click on targets that appear on the screen within a certain time limit while avoiding running out of lives. Let's explore how the code operates and how you can customize it to create different gaming experiences.

## How to Play

- Run the Python script to start the game.
- Click on the targets that appear on the screen within the specified time limit.
- Avoid running out of lives by missing too many targets.
- Keep track of your hits, misses, and overall accuracy.

## Customization Options

You can customize various aspects of the game by adjusting the constants defined in the script:

- `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT`: Define the dimensions of the game window.
- `TARGET_INCREMENT`: Time interval (in milliseconds) at which new targets will appear.
- `TARGET_PADDING`: Minimum distance from the edge of the window for target placement.
- `BG_COLOR`: Background color of the game window.
- `LIVES`: Number of lives the player has.
- `TOP_BAR_HEIGHT`: Height of the top bar displaying game information.

Feel free to experiment with these constants to create different gaming experiences. You can adjust the difficulty level, target appearance frequency, window size, and more to suit your preferences.

## Dependencies

- Pygame library

## Running the Game

Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed on your system. You can install Pygame using pip:

```bash

Execute the Python script and the game window will appear, and you can start playing immediately.

## End Game

When the game ends, you'll see a summary screen displaying your performance. You have the option to quit the game by pressing any key or the 'ESC' key. If you want to play again, press the 'r' key.
